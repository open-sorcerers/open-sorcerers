Today we're gonna talk through the process I use to rewrite / refactor imperative 3rd-party modules into functional javascript, and then work through a real-life example.

## Search for the right source module

When re-writing someone else's code, pick a problem domain that is well-defined and small, or if not small, then well-tested. Often in node-land there are several libraries which do mainly the same thing with a couple of nearly fungible trade-offs. Picking the right source library will give you a leg up, as then you don't have to redefine the problem domain yourself. And if you pick a library with good tests you can re-use, then you don't have to re-do that part of the problem.
