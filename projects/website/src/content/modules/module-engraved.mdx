## A complement to `polished`

`polished` is a lovely library for providing the kinds of mixin utilities you may be used to in languages which target css (SASS / LESS) but for css-in-js. However, if (just, as a for instance) you are looking to build a performant page which allows you to toggle between radically different themes, then you might want to do something to take a theme that looks like this:

```js
const theme = {
  elements: {
    button: {
      color: '#c0ffee',
      background: '#ffcc00',
      active: {color: mix(1/2, '#c00', '#c0ffee'), background: '#ffcc00'}
    }
  }
}
```

and turn it into a flattened, static, deduplicated version of it:

```js
const $c0ffee = '#c0ffee'
const $ffcc00 = '#ffcc00'
const $c67f77 = '#c67f77'
export default Object.freeze({
  elementsButtonColor: $c0ffee,
  elementsButtonBackground: $ffcc00,
  elementsButtonActiveColor: $c67f77,
  elementsButtonActiveBackground: $ffcc00
})
```
