# Open Sorcerers
## Functional Programming &times; JavaScript &times; Open-Source

Our goal is to create a community dedicated to highlighting effective usage of the Functional Programming (FP) paradigm in JavaScript. We hope to provide tools, resources and training towards this goal.

### Learn about the FP Paradigm

We believe that following the core tenets of FP leads to cleaner, simpler and easier-to-reason-about code. Check out our [Learning](/learn) page for the core tenets and additional resources.
