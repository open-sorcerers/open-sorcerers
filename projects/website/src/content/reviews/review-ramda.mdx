<PackageInstaller pkg="ramda">
  A practical functional library for JavaScript programmers
</PackageInstaller>

`ramda` is essential. If I'm going to write any code of any real utility, I'm most likely to reach for `ramda` to create clean transformational pipelines. All of its functions are automatically curried and it never mutates data.

Part of what I really like about it is that you can use it to compose simple and pure functions to get great complexity. Look at how each function in the `capitalize` function below is pure and very easy to reason about.

```js
import {
  ap,
  curry,
  join,
  map,
  pipe,
  slice,
  split,
  toLower,
  toUpper
} from 'ramda'

const capitalize = curry(
  (joint, xxx) => pipe(
    split(' '),
    map(pipe(
      z => [z], // "box"
      ap([
        slice(0, 1),
        slice(1, Infinity)
      ])
    )),
    map(
      // note how we're consuming an array here!
      ([a, lphabet]) => (
        toUpper(a) + toLower(lphabet)
      )
    ),
    join(joint)
  )(xxx)
)

capitalize('! ', 'ramda is very cool')
```

_Oooh tacit goodness_!

## Learning

When learning `ramda`, I highly recommend:

1. Playing in the node REPL:

```sh
node
> R = require('ramda')
> R.keys(R)
```

2. When sharing code with others, use the online [Ramda REPL](//ramdajs.org/repl) for simple sandboxing
3. Install `eslint-plugin-ramda` for some automatic (though a few are unhelpful) refactoring suggestions via eslint.

**NB**: `ramda` has 255 functions within it. I'd say I use a maximum of about ~30 of them. Don't get overwhelmed by the sheer size of `ramda` and instead focus on the essentials.

## Essential `ramda`

- `__` &mdash; It's a magic placeholder!
- `curry` &mdash; Defer parameters for when you have them! Partial application FTW.
- `pipe` &mdash; Function composition!
- `map` &mdash; Ooh what a functor!
- `propOr` &mdash; Grab a property or a default value! Safety!
- `pathOr` &mdash; Grab a nested property or a default value! Extra safety!
- `ap` &mdash; Segment your data cleanly and divine lines through it.
- `propEq` &mdash; Assert property equivalence to static values!
- `propSatisfies` &mdash; Assert whatever you want with a predicate function!
- `ifElse` &mdash; When your tacit pipelines need conditional branching!
- `not` &mdash; Invert boolean values in your pipes!
- `complement` &mdash; Invert the outcome from a given function 

## Examples

Let's go into some examples!

##### Specify gaps with a magic placeholder `__`

The magic placeholder allows you to define gaps in a curried function.

```js
import { curry, __ } from 'ramda'
const ternary = curry((a, b, c) => a + b / c)
const sumOver3 = ternary(__, __, 3)
```

You can also get the same functionality by playing with `flip`, but IMO this is slightly harder to read / reason about.

```js
import { __, curry } from 'ramda'
const divide = curry((a, b) => a / b)
// divide(3) === 3 / x (not super useful)
const over3 = divide(__, 3) === x / 3
// identical:
// import {flip} from 'ramda'
// flip(divide)(3) === divide(__)(3)
```

##### Safe property access with `pathOr` / `propOr` 

Safely access properties! Remember the order here, it's default value, followed by property or path-to-property, followed by the object / whatever itself.

```js
const eventTargetValue = pathOr(false, ['target', 'value'])
const orFalse = propOr(false)
orFalse('someProperty', {}) // false
```

##### Apply with `ap`

`ap` applies a list of functions to a list of values. **NB** In most cases, remember to encase your values in an array beforehand! I always refer to this as `box` but you do you.

```js
import { ap, pipe, pathOr } from 'ramda'
// this is the easiest thing to forget --
// if you don't box before you `ap` you will
// likely not have the data you expect in your output
const box = x => [x]
const data = {
  a: { aa: { aaa: 111 } },
  b: { bb: { bbb: 222 } },
  c: { cc: { ccc: 333 } }
}

const safeNestedAccessors = pipe(
  // remember to box before you ap
  box,
  ap([
    pathOr(-1, ['a', 'aa', 'aaa']),
    pathOr(-2, ['b', 'bb', 'bbb']),
    pathOr(-3, ['c', 'cc', 'ccc']),
    pathOr(1, ['d', 'dd', 'ddd'])
  ]),
  ([a, b, c, d]) => `nested sum: ${a + b + c / d}`
)

safeNestedAccessors(data)
```

##### Assert stuff with `propEq` / `propSatisfies` / `ifElse`

Use `propEq` to compare static values, and `propSatisfies` to compare via a function which receives the property as its input. Use `ifElse` to create conditional branches while still using tacit pipes.

```js
import {
  identity,
  ifElse,
  not,
  pipe,
  propEq
} from 'ramda'

// ifElse takes three unary functions which all receive the same input
const goodOrBad = ifElse(
  // input => if the input.status !== 200
  pipe(propEq('status', 200), not),
  // input => return the input with an error value
  input => ({ input, error: true }),
  // return input
  identity
)
```

Here's the same thing again but using `propSatisfies` and `complement` instead of `propEq` and `not`, respectively. Note the order of parameters for `propSatisfies`, the predicate comes _before_ the property.

```js
import {
  complement,
  equals,
  identity as I,
  mergeRight,
  ifElse,
  pipe,
  propSatisfies
} from 'ramda'

const goodOrBad = ifElse(
  // input => if the input.status !== 200
  // propSatisfies(x => x !== 200, 'status') // equivalent
  propSatisfies(complement(equals)(200), 'status')),
  mergeRight({ error: true }),
  I
)
```
