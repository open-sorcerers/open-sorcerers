# captain-planet 

*Protect the environment*! Document your environment vars.

```sh
yarn add captain-planet
captain-planet init
captain-planet
```

Add an environment variable without documenting it, it's pollution!

```sh
echo "process.env.POLLUTION = 'I love pollution'" > some-file.js
captain-planet
```
