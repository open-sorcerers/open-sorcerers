<PackageInstaller pkg="nps" dev>
All the benefits of npm scripts without the cost of a bloated package.json and the limits of json
</PackageInstaller>

`nps` is one of the first packages I go to whenever creating a new module. It is a wonderful solution to the limits of `package.json` and the need to have build scripts. It offers a number of simple solutions out of the box, and even more if you use `nps-utils` as well.

Once you've installed it, you can create a file called `package-scripts.js` (there is also a YAML flavor which is nice until your scripts get verbose) which looks kinda like the following:

```js
module.exports = {
  // invariably I forget this inner property wrapping when doing it from scratch
  scripts: {
    lint: {
      script: `eslint src/. --fix`,
      description: `Run lint on stuff`
    }
  }
}
```

As your application becomes more complex, you can avail yourself of `nps-utils`, which allows for some smart command-line concurrency and more.

```js
const npsUtils = require('nps-utils') // not required, but useful

module.exports = {
  scripts: {
    lint: {
      description: `Run lint on stuff`
      script: npsUtils.concurrent.nps(`lint.eslint`, `lint.stylelint`)
      eslint: {
        script: `eslint src/. --fix`,
      },
      stylelint: {
        script: `stylelint src/. --fix`
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Another nicety of `nps` is that it does fuzzy pattern matching, so you can run `nps lint` or `nps li` interchangeably, or more granular things like `nps lint.eslint` or `nps li.es`

I highly recommend you add `nps` to any project which is non-trivial in size. I've been using it in my open-source work as well as at my job, and in most folders I can run `nps care` and it will run all of the integration tests and linting for a given project.

I like to use it in concert with `lint-staged` and delegate more complicated scripts in lint-staged to ones already defined in `package-scripts.js`.
