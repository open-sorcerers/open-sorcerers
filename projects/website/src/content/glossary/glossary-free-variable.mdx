A free-variable is a global variable or variable defined externally to the function.

```js
// window is a free variable with respect to `save`
const save = data => window.localStorage.setItem('saved', data)
```

You can use the [free-variable partial-application pattern] to fix this problem and turn this function [pure](/glossary/pure):

```js
const checkWindowExists = () => typeof window !== 'undefined'

const saveWithContext = fn => data => fn('saved', data)
// [...]

if (checkWindowExists()) {
  const save = saveWithContext(window.localStorage.setItem.bind(window.localStorage))
}
```

If the above seems overkill, or needless, just remember that a runtime error can crash everything in JS land and a free benefit of the pattern is that you get the ability to inject mocks into your tests (e.g. `const save = saveWithContext(jest.fn())` for instance). So pick your battles.
