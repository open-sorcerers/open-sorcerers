excerpt: As we're trying to move towards cleaner and simpler code through FP, how can we identify code that needs to be cleaned up in transition?

Previously we've talked a bit about the utility of FP and some of its [core tenets].

In this post we're going to talk about how to identify patterns for potential cleanup in imperative code, on our path to tacit functional code.

## Identify patterns

The bulk of the rewriting is in the simplification of the underlying patterns at play in someone's code. Identify any of the following as candidates for clean-up and refactoring:

 1. **Constants** &mdash; these include strings which are used in any place more than once, as well as "magic numbers" &mdash; the idea here is that by enforcing re-use of constants instead of using in-function strings / numbers / whatever, you can both decrease the likelihood you'll make a mistake by reference as well as making the domain of the code more explicit.
 2. **Free variables** &mdash; anything which makes use of globals is inherently unsafe. Use the [free-variable-partial-application pattern](#free-variable-partial-application-pattern) below to closure any global variables and make the code safe.
 3. **Repeated code** &mdash; by identifying repetition and eschewing copy-pasta, we can more easily scan our code and find the most efficient places to make change in the future.
 4. **Unsafe code / assumptions** &mdash; Because of the coercive nature of JS comparison and the way in which most developers write only for the best-case scenario there are many different ways your code can fail. Here are a few common ones:

   - Nested property access. Anything nested more than one-level deep is unsafe in JS without chained `&&`s. Likely you should use something like [ramda](//npmjs.org/package/ramda)'s `pathOr` function to both safely access nested properties as well as provide a fallback in the case of missing properties.
   - for loops, for...each loops &mdash; There are a few cases where for loops are wonderful and perfect solutions. However, in most cases it is preferable to use `map` instead, as dealing with discrete values is much nicer than being in the dark.
   - Uncaught errors &mdash; Often you will see a developer has taken a `try ... catch` pattern and used it to to swallow errors silently. This is almost always a mistake.
   - Misused asynchrony &mdash; If properly managed, `Promises` and `async / await` are okay solutions for managing asynchrony. All too often they are misused or only written for the ideal case. I am a huge proponent of using [fluture](//npmjs.org/package/fluture) to model asynchrony, as it is lazy, monadic, cancellable and explicit about how things should work, especially error handling.
 5. **Complex code** &mdash; functions should be made as simple and unequivocal as possible. Ideally, use function composition to weave together simple functions to manage greater complexity.
 6. **Impure functions** &mdash; Any function which is making use of free variables or is calling a function but isn't keeping the result of that call around is impure. Sometimes this is unavoidable. Often it is a code-smell which indicates bigger problems underneath the interface.
 7. **Data destruction** &mdash; Often the imperative JS approach involves deleting or mutating data in place. The FP approach is to make a copy of the data and treat all inputs as immutable.
 8. **Classes** &mdash; JS classes _can_ be very clean and nice. In practice they are often used in places where they do not need to be used &mdash; either where needing to remember to instantiate them first is a footgun / additional headache or where usage of `this` makes a function impure.

## Free Variable Partial-Application Pattern
## aka Closured Global Pattern 

Let's say you have to deal with some code which does something like the following:

```js
const saveData = (key, value) => {
  window.localStorage.setItem(key, value)
}
```

If you're familiar with your basic JS environments, `window` is tied to the browser but doesn't exist on the server / in node without a shim &mdash; so this function is unsafe.

However, look at how we can make this function be identical in functionality but also perfectly safe:

```js
const saveDataWithStorage = storage => (key, value) => {
  storage.setItem(key, value)
}
// or with ramda, you can have automatic currying, which is probably what you want
// import {curry} from 'ramda'
// saveDataWithStorage = curry((storage, key, value) => {})
// ostensibly this could also be in the body of the function itself
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  const saveData = saveDataWithStorage(window.localStorage.bind(window.localStorage)
}
```

By closuring the global function we're making use of, we can safely use that function in more places, and we have more explicit definition around what our dependencies / requirements are. Another nice free benefit of this pattern is that you can easily inject shims for testing purposes, so maintaining 100% unit test coverage is pretty easy.
