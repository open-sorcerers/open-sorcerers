# Trace

Trace is a simple pattern which allows for invoking a [binary](/glossary/binary) [side-effect](/glossary/side-effect) in composition - normally we want to stay away from side-effects, but here we're exploiting side-effects to very simply augment our composed pipeline:

```js
import {__, pipe, curry} from 'ramda'
const traceSideEffect = curry((fn, a, b) => {
  fn(a, b)
  return b
})
const trace = traceSideEffect(console.log)
// OR (shameless plug)
// import {trace} from 'xtrace'
const addAndDivide = curry(
  (a, b, c) => pipe(
    add(a),
    trace('a + b'),
    divide(__, c),
    trace('output')
  )(b)
)
```
