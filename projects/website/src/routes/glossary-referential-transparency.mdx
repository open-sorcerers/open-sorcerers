## Referentially Transparent

A function which (when invoked with all inputs) can be replaced in all instances without changing the program's behavior.

```js
const times = a => b => a * b
const double = times(2)
const ten = double(5) 
const four = double(2) 
const forty = times(ten)(four)
times(ten)(four) === times(times(2)(5))(times(2)(2))
```
