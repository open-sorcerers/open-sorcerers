# Function

A relationship or expression involving one or more variables.

```js
const a = () => `hip arrow function`
const b = function () { return `assigned anonymous function` }
function c() { return `named function` }
```

<!-- Properties of Functions: -->

## Arity

The number of parameters a function takes.

### Nullary

A function which takes zero parameters. 

```js
const nullary = () => `nothing`
```

### Unary

A function which takes one parameter, or is said to have an [arity](/glossary/arity) of 1.

```js
const unary = thing => `one ${thing}`
```

### Binary 

A function which takes two parameters, or is said to have an [arity](/glossary/arity) of 2.

```js
const binary = (thing1, thing2) => `${thing1} => ${thing2}`
const binaryMC = thing1 => thing2 => `${thing1} => ${thing2}`
const binaryC = curry((thing1, thing2) => `${thing1} => ${thing2}`)
```

### Ternary

A function which takes three parameters, or is said to have an [arity](/glossary/arity) of 3.

```js
const ternary = (a, b, c) => a + b + c
const ternaryMC = a => b => c => a + b + c 
const ternaryC = curry((a, b, c) => a + b + c)
```

## Purity

A function which is [deterministic](/glossary/deterministic) has no side-effects and is [referentially transparent](/glossary/refentially-transparent).

## Deterministic

A function which will always return the same output given the same input.

```js
const identity = x => x
```

## Referentially Transparent

A function which (when invoked with all inputs) can be replaced in all instances without changing the program's behavior.

```js
const times = a => b => a * b
const double = times(2)
const ten = double(5) 
const four = double(2) 
const forty = times(ten)(four)
times(ten)(four) === times(times(2)(5))(times(2)(2))
```

<!-- Category: Functions -->

## Composition

An operation which takes two or more functions and returns a unary function.

```js
const f = x =>  x
const g = x => y
const h = x => f(g(x))
import {pipe} from 'ramda'
const h = pipe(f, g)
```

## Higher-Order Function

A function which takes a function and possible additional parameters, and returns a function.

```js
const map = fn => xs => xs.map(fn)
map(times(2))([1,2,3]) === [2,4,6]
```
