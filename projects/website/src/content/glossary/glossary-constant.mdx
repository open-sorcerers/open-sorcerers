<Def of="Constant" parent="Combinator" />

The `constant` function takes what it is given and returns a nullary function which returns the original value. Sometimes called `always` or the `K` combinator.

```js
const K = x => () => x
// import { always as K } from 'ramda'
const alwaysCool = K('cool')
alwaysCool() === 'cool'
```
