Here's today's daily module roundup:

* [Fre](https://github.com/yisar/fre)
  <blockquote class="one-liner">Tiny Reac16 like framework with Concurrent</blockquote>
  Seems like a potentially interesting alternative to React. However, I saw a flash-of-unrendered-content, so unclear whether it's ready for primetime yet.
* [22120](https://github.com/dosyago/22120)
  <blockquote class="one-liner">Self-host the Internet with an Offline Archive</blockquote>
  A very cool idea. Offhand this seems like a potential security risk, but as someone who often likes to work offline this is a boon.
