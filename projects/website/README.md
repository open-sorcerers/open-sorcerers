# Open Sorcerers
## Functional Programming &times; JavaScript &times; Open-Source

Our goal is to create a community dedicated towards:
* highlighting effective usage of the Functional Programming (FP) paradigm in JavaScript.
* demonstrating good practices for open-source software (OSS)
We hope to provide tools, resources and training towards these goals.

### Learn about the FP Paradigm

We believe that following the [core tenets] of FP leads to cleaner, simpler and easier-to-reason-about code. Check out our [Learning] page for the core tenets and additional resources.

#### Create or Contribute to Open-Source JavaScript modules

If you want to get started writing code, check us out on [Github].

This site is built on [Gatsby] using the [foresight-gatsby-starter].

##### Meet cool people, learn about software and have fun

Please reach out to us on [Slack] or [Twitter] or meet us in person at a [Meetup].
