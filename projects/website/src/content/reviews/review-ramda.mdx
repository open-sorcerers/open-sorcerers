<PackageInstaller pkg="ramda">
A practical functional library for JavaScript programmers
</PackageInstaller>

`ramda` is essential. If I'm going to write any code of any real utility, I'm most likely to reach for `ramda` to create clean transformational pipelines.

```js
import {curry, split, pipe, map} from 'ramda'

export const capitalize = pipe(
  split(' '),
  map(pipe(
    z => [z],
    ap([slice(0, 1), slice(1, Infinity)]),
  )),
  map(([a, lphabet]) => toUpper(a) + toLower(lphabet)),
  join('\n')
)
```

_Oooh tacit goodness_!

When learning `ramda`, I highly recommend:

1. Playing in the node REPL:
  ```sh
  node
  > R = require('ramda')
  > R.keys(R)
  ```
2. When sharing code with others, use the online [Ramda REPL](//ramdajs.org/repl) for simple sandboxing
3. Install `eslint-plugin-ramda` for some automatic (though a few are unhelpful) refactoring suggestions via eslint.

**NB**: `ramda` has 255 functions within it. I'd say I use a maximum of about ~30 of them. Don't get overwhelmed by the sheer size of `ramda` and instead focus on the essentials.

## Essential `ramda`

* `curry` &mdash; Defer parameters for when you have them! Partial application FTW.
* `pipe` &mdash; Function composition!
* `map` &mdash; Ooh what a functor!
* `propOr` &mdash; Grab a property or a default value! Safety!
* `pathOr` &mdash; Grab a nested property or a default value! Extra safety!
* `nth` &mdash; Grab the value of array[index]
* `ap` &mdash; Segment your data cleanly and divine lines through it.
* `__` &mdash; It's a magic placeholder!
